        useful if you are inside of another tag (like &lt;r:find&gt;) and need to refer back to the <br /> current child."

      attribute to specify that if a page does not have a content part by that name that
      the tag should render the parent's content part. By default @inherit@ is set to
      @false@. Use the @contextual@ attribute to force a part inherited from a parent
      part to be evaluated in the context of the child page. By default 'contextual'

    date: "Renders the date based on the current page (by default when it was published or created).
      The format attribute uses the same formating codes used by the Ruby @strftime@ function. By
      default it's set to &#37;A, &#37;B &#37;d, &#37;Y. The @for@ attribute selects which date to render.  Valid
      options are @published_at@, @created_at@, @updated_at@, and @now@. @now@ will render the
      current date/time, regardless of the  page."
      
    link: "Renders a link to the page. When used as a single tag it uses the page's title
      for the link name. When used as a double tag the part in between both tags will
      be used as the link text. The link tag passes all attributes over to the HTML
      @a@ tag. This is very useful for passing attributes like the @class@ attribute
      or @id@ attribute. If the @anchor@ attribute is passed to the tag it will
      append a pound sign (<code>#</code>) followed by the value of the attribute to
      the @href@ attribute of the HTML @a@ tag--effectively making an HTML anchor."
      
    breadcrumbs: "Renders a trail of breadcrumbs to the current page. The separator attribute
      specifies the HTML fragment that is inserted between each of the breadcrumbs. By
      default it is set to @>@. The boolean nolinks attribute can be specified to render
      breadcrumbs in plain text, without any links (useful when generating title tag)."
    snippet: 
      part_1: "Renders the snippet specified in the @name@ attribute within the context of a page."
      part_2: "When used as a double tag, the part in between both tags may be used within the snippet itself, being substituted in place of @<r:yield/>@."
    
    yield:
      part_1: "Used within a snippet as a placeholder for substitution of child content, when the snippet is called as a double tag."
      usage: "Usage (within a snippet):"
      part_2: 'If the above snippet was named "yielding", you could call it from any Page,
        Layout or Snippet as follows:'
